  We document that return anomalies related to management discretions are mitigated for firms followed by more experienced analysts. Nonetheless, only experience directly covering the firm matters while experience covering other firms is not associated with greater price efficiency. Focusing on the accrual anomaly, we then examine research and monitoring as possible channels through which experience mitigates mispricing. For firms followed by more experienced analysts, we find that forecast revisions and stock prices respond more positively to the accrual component of earnings. We further find that accrual quality is higher in firms followed by more experienced analysts, which holds after using both  propensity score matching[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/propensity-score-matching "Learn more about propensity score matching from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and exogenous events of  brokerage closures and  mergers[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/merger "Learn more about mergers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to control for endogeneity. Collectively, our results are consistent with monitoring being the primary mechanism by which experienced analysts reduce accrual mispricing.
