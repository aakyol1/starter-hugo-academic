title: Corporate gender culture
summary: We use computational linguistic models to create the first systematic measures of 'corporate gender culture' in Australian firms and find that workplace culture is gendered. Our findings indicate that firms exhibit systematic gender differentiation, with variations across industries, and the cultural dimension that most influences women's representation in leadership and firm performance is the equality of training opportunities.

We show workplace culture is gendered. We apply computational linguistic models to listed firms’ reports to an Australian gender-equality agency to construct the first systematic measures of ‘corporate gender culture’—firms’ practices pertaining to the treatment of women across seven dimensions, from recruitment and promotion to maternity leave and sexual harassment.


Our measures reveal that firms treat women systematically differently from men, but also that gender differentiation varies across industry and firm characteristics. The cultural dimension that best predicts women’s representation in corporate leadership is also the one that best predicts firm performance, namely equality of training opportunities.
