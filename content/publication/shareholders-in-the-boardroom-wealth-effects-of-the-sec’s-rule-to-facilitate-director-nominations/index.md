abstract: "Current attempts to reform financial markets presume that shareholder
  empowerment benefits shareholders. We investigate the wealth effects
  associated with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rule to facilitate
  director nominations by shareholders. Our results are not in line with
  shareholder empowerment creating value: The average daily abnormal returns
  surrounding events that increase (decrease) the probability of the proposal’s
  passage are significantly negative (positive). Furthermore, given an increase
  in the probability of the proposal’s passage, firms whose shareholders are
  more likely to use the rule to nominate directors experience more negative
  abnormal returns."
