abstract: Using repurchase reasons provided by Australian companies for their
  stock repurchase programs, we ask if the marketâ€™s response is different across
  repurchase motivations by examining actual daily share repurchases. We find
  that firms with the undervaluation motive experience a more positive stock
  price reaction when they report their repurchases to the market. We show that
  undervaluation motive firms repurchase fewer shares and have a lower program
  completion rate than other motives firms. During the 1-year period following
  the repurchases, undervaluation motive firms do better than their control
  sample firms whereas other motive firms do not perform better or worse than
  their control sample firms. Overall, our results suggest that the
  undervaluation motive is a stronger signal than other repurchase motives, and
  contrary to the predictions of the standard signaling theories, management
  statements carry some value for the market. We also present some evidence
  suggesting that a costly action may not be needed for a signal to be credible.

summary: "Analyzing Australian companies' stock repurchases based on their
  motivations, we find that firms with undervaluation motives have a more
  positive stock price reaction. These firms repurchase fewer shares and perform
  better in the year following repurchases. Undervaluation motives signal
  strength, and management statements hold value for the market. "
