abstract: Directors are not one-dimensional. We characterize their skill sets by
  exploiting Regulation S-K’s 2009 requirement that U.S. firms must disclose the
  experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills that led the nominating
  committee to choose an individual as a director. We then examine how skills
  cluster on and across boards. Factor analysis indicates that the main
  dimension along which boards vary is in the diversity of skills of their
  directors. We find that firm performance increases when director skill sets
  exhibit more commonality.
