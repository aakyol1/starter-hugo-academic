abstract: We examine the choice between accelerated share repurchase (ASR) and
  open market repurchase (OMR) as repurchase mechanisms between 2004 and 2007.
  For a sample of ASRs and OMRs that actually buy shares in the announcement
  quarter, we find that ASR firms have lower market-to-book ratios, less cash,
  but greater managerial entrenchment. Prior to repurchase, ASR firms are
  subject to significantly more takeover rumors than OMR firms are, and this,
  along with entrenchment and undervaluation, affects the choice to use ASRs.
  ASR firms experience positive average abnormal returns both before and after
  the announcement. Moreover, the latent takeover probability is significantly
  lower for both ASR and OMR firms (when compared with pre-announcement levels),
  but the reduction for ASR firms is more pronounced. Our results suggest that
  repurchases, and especially ASRs, indeed make a firm a less attractive
  prospect for takeover.

summary: We compare accelerated share repurchases (ASR) and open market
  repurchases (OMR) between 2004 and 2007. ASR firms had lower market-to-book
  ratios, less cash, and higher managerial entrenchment. ASR firms were subject
  to more takeover rumors, influencing their choice. ASR firms experienced
  positive returns and reduced takeover probability.
