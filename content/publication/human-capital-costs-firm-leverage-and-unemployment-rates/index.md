abstract: Because bankruptcy is costly for employees, theoretical studies argue
  that firms with higher leverage have to pay their employees higher wages. In
  this paper we empirically test this prediction. We find that firm leverage is
  positively related to the wages of employees, both in the United States and in
  the Netherlands. In the United States, the positive relation between wages and
  leverage is strongest in the 21st century, which is a period that also shows a
  positive relation between wages and unemployment rates. We conclude that the
  human capital costs of bankruptcy are an important disadvantage of debt.

summary: Higher firm leverage is linked to higher employee wages in both the
  United States and the Netherlands. This effect is strongest in the 21st
  century in the United States, reflecting the impact of higher unemployment
  rates.
