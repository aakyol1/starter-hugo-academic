abstract: We examine the wealth effects of the Security and Exchange
  Commission’s (SEC) recent proxy access rule to facilitate director nominations
  by shareholders. We focus on how a firm’s governance characteristics affect
  the market reaction to the rule. We find more negative announcement effects
  for firms with high probabilities of being targeted by shareholders. The
  announcement effects of the proxy access rule are positively related to the
  fraction of independent directors and the ratio of non-cash-based
  compensation, while announcement effects are inversely correlated with board
  size. Our findings suggest that the marginal shareholder does not perceive the
  proposed rule as value increasing.

summary: We analyze the SEC's proxy access rule and its impact on shareholder wealth focusing on firms' governance characteristics. Firms with a high probability of being targeted have more negative returns while independent directors and non-cash compensation positively influence the market's reaction. Smaller boards have less negative impact, suggesting the rule isn't seen as value-enhancing by marginal shareholders.
