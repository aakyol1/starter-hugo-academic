abstract: I examine intraday stock returns in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE)
  around nontrading periods – weekends and holidays – by utilizing the
  exchange’s structure of two trading sessions. I find that returns are
  generally more positive in the last session on Fridays and more negative in
  the first session on Mondays. The results also indicate that the weekend
  effect has disappeared in the ISE in recent years. I further find some
  evidence that there is a relationship between the length of a holiday
  nontrading period and returns around it. The longer a nontrading period is,
  the more positive the returns are in the morning session before the holiday
  and the less positive the returns are in the morning session after the
  holiday. My findings indicate the importance of the uncertainty imposed on
  stock returns by the length of a nontrading period.
