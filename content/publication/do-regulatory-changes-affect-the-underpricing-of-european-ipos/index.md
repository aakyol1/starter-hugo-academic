abstract: We use a sample of 3677 European IPOs during the period 1998â€“2012 to
  examine how the adoptions of corporate governance codes by Member States of
  the European Union (EU) have affected IPO underpricing on Member
  State-regulated markets, where issuers are subject to corporate governance
  rules instituted by Member States, relative to a control sample of IPOs on
  exchange-regulated markets, where issuers are exempt from Member State
  corporate governance codes. Using this control sample approach facilitated by
  the existence of second-tier, exchange-regulated markets in the EU, we find
  that, on average, IPO underpricing declined on Member State-regulated markets
  after Member States adopted corporate governance codes containing SOX-like
  provisions. We do not find a similar reduction in IPO underpricing on
  exchange-regulated markets. Our results are robust to alternative
  specifications, and our findings support the view that elevating corporate
  governance standards increases transparency and reduces information
  asymmetries that affect IPO valuations.

summary: We analyze 3677 European IPOs from 1998 to 2012. When Member States in
  the EU implemented governance codes like SOX, IPO underpricing decreased on
  their regulated markets compared to exchange-regulated ones. Improved
  governance enhances transparency and reduces information asymmetries in IPO
  valuations.
