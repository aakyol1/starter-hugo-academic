abstract: We document that return anomalies related to management discretions
  are mitigated for firms followed by more experienced analysts. Nonetheless,
  only experience directly covering the firm matters while experience covering
  other firms is not associated with greater price efficiency. Focusing on the
  accrual anomaly, we then examine research and monitoring as possible channels
  through which experience mitigates mispricing. For firms followed by more
  experienced analysts, we find that forecast revisions and stock prices respond
  more positively to the accrual component of earnings. We further find that
  accrual quality is higher in firms followed by more experienced analysts,
  which holds after using both propensity score matching and exogenous events of
  brokerage closures and mergers to control for endogeneity. Collectively, our
  results are consistent with monitoring being the primary mechanism by which
  experienced analysts reduce accrual mispricing.
