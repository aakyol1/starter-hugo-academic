abstract: We show that companies that use search firms to find board members pay
  their CEOs significantly higher salaries and significantly higher total
  compensations. Further, companies with search firm-identified independent
  directors are significantly less likely to fire their CEOs following negative
  performance. In addition, companies with search firm-identified independent
  directors are significantly more likely to engage in mergers and acquisitions
  (M&A) and see abnormally low returns from this M&A activity. We instrument the
  endogenous choice of using an executive search through the varying geographic
  distance of companies to executive search firms. Using this instrumental
  variable framework, we show search firm-identified independent directorsâ€™
  negative impact on firm performance, consistent with firm behavior and
  governance consequences we document.

summary: Companies using search firms for board members pay CEOs higher salaries
  and total compensations. Such companies are less likely to fire CEOs after
  poor performance and more likely to engage in M&A with low returns. Using
  geographic distance as an instrument, we find search firm-identified directors
  negatively impact firm performance and governance.
