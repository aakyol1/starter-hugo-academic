abstract: In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reformed
  shareholder voting by eliminating uninstructed broker voting in director
  elections. We use this reform as a quasi-natural experiment to assess the
  value of shareholder empowerment. Using different control groups and various
  cross-sectional tests, we find that the reform did not increase average equity
  values.
